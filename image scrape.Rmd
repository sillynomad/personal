This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(rvest)  
library(stringr)
library(httr)




#extract links from file
url <- read.csv(file.choose())
linklist <- url$Link
#create data frame for the extracted image urls
df <- data.frame(1:100)

for (item in linklist) {
  if (item == ""){
    return()
  }
  if (http_status(GET(item))$category == "Client error"){
    imgsrc <- "NA"
  }
  else {
  print(item)

  
  
#collect the src (image URLs) of all the images on the website
imgsrc <- read_html(item
) %>%
  html_nodes(xpath = '//*/img') %>%
  html_attr('src')


#save on to 1 column of a table where each URL is in a different row
add.col<-function(df, new.col) {n.row<-dim(df)[1]
           length(new.col)<-n.row
           cbind(df, new.col)
}
df<-add.col(df,imgsrc)
length(imgsrc)
  }
}

write.csv(df, file = "pulledimages.csv")

```






Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
